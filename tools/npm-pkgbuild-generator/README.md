# NPM PKGBUILD Generator

A tool to generate PKGBUILD's for NPM packages.

This tool requires Python 3. Run `./gen` and answer the questions. The tool fetches package info from NPM and puts it into the PKGBUILD template.

The template is from the [Node.js Packaging Guidelines](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Node.js_package_guidelines).

**There is no gurantee that PKGBUILD's will work. Every PKGBUILD should be manually checked.**
